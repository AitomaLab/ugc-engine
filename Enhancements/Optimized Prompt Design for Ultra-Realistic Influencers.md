# Optimized Prompt Design for Ultra-Realistic Influencers
## A Guide for Training Antigravity with Seedance 1.5 Pro

## The Problem: Why Current Prompts Fail

Your current prompts are failing to produce exciting, natural-sounding influencers for one primary reason: they are **too corporate, too abstract, and not specific enough** for the AI. Seedance 1.5 Pro is interpreting your long, brand-guideline-style descriptions and formal scripts literally, resulting in a dull, robotic spokesperson instead of an engaging UGC creator.

The key is to shift from describing a *brand persona* to directing an *actor's performance*. The AI needs explicit, detailed instructions on how to look, act, and sound on a moment-by-moment basis.

## The Solution: The Ultra-Realistic Influencer Prompt

This new prompt structure is designed to be concise, specific, and focused on visual and vocal performance. It replaces abstract corporate values with concrete, actionable directions.

### Master Prompt Template for Antigravity

Here is the master template. You should train Antigravity to populate the `[dynamic content]` fields based on the specific video's hook, influencer, and theme.

```
### PROMPT START ###

## 1. Core Concept (1-2 sentences)
- **Style**: An authentic, high-energy, handheld smartphone selfie video for social media (TikTok/Reels).
- **Action**: [Influencer Name], a [brief, visual description], is excitedly sharing an amazing discovery directly with their followers.

## 2. Visual Style (3-4 bullet points)
- **Camera**: Close-up shot, held at arm's length slightly above eye level. The framing is tight on the face and upper body. There is a slight, natural handheld shake, as if talking to a friend.
- **Lighting**: Bright, natural light from a window is illuminating the influencer's face, creating soft, flattering shadows and a sparkle in their eyes.
- **Environment**: An authentic, lived-in setting like a [cozy bedroom with a bookshelf | modern kitchen with coffee machine | car interior during the day]. The background is slightly out of focus (shallow depth of field).
- **Aesthetic**: Raw, energetic, and genuine. Not a polished advertisement.

## 3. Performance - Visual (4-5 bullet points)
- **Eye Contact**: MUST maintain direct, engaging eye contact with the camera lens throughout, creating a personal connection.
- **Facial Expression**: A sequence of authentic, high-energy emotions. Start with a wide-eyed, eyebrow-raised look of surprise. Transition to a huge, genuine smile showing teeth. End with a confident, knowing smirk.
- **Body Language**: Dynamic and animated. Lean into the camera when emphasizing a point. Use expressive hand gestures like pointing directly at the viewer, waving excitedly, or giving a thumbs-up.
- **Energy Level**: High-energy, infectious enthusiasm from start to finish. The influencer should seem genuinely thrilled and unable to contain their excitement.

## 4. Performance - Vocal (4-5 bullet points)
- **Language & Dialect**: Speak in a natural, colloquial Castilian Spanish (Spain dialect), as if talking to a close friend.
- **Tone & Emotion**: The tone is overwhelmingly EXCITED and AMAZED. The voice should be filled with energy, rising in pitch and volume on key words. It should sound like they just discovered the best secret ever.
- **Pacing & Rhythm**: A varied, natural pace. Speak quickly during the exciting parts, then pause for a beat to let a key point land. Avoid a monotonous, even rhythm.
- **Vocal Specifics**: Use natural vocalizations. Start with an audible gasp or an excited "¡Eh, tío!". Emphasize the ALL CAPS words in the script with a vocal PUNCH. End sentences with a slight upward inflection to maintain energy.

## 5. Script (The Dialogue)
- **Hook**: "[Excited interjection like ¡Tío, para todo! or ¡No te lo vas a creer!]"
- **Main Point**: "[Main message, rewritten colloquially, e.g., Esta app me ha encontrado los MEJORES precios... ¡es BRUTAL!]"
- **Call to Action**: "[Urgent and friendly CTA, e.g., Tienes que probarla. ¡Descárgala YA, el link está en mi bio!]"

## Before vs. After: A Concrete Example

Let's apply this to your "Max" influencer.

### ❌ BEFORE (Current Dull Prompt)

```
UGC-style selfie video. Max is a tech-forward, precision-driven personal shopping assistant... [150+ words of corporate description]... Analytical & Precise... Efficient but Human... Voice Style is clean, direct, and modern... He speaks in Castilian Spanish (Spain) with a Enthusiastic expression. He says convincingly: "Ahorra dinero en tus compras con Max. ¡Descárgala ya, link en mi bio!". Vertical 9:16 format. Realistic, warm and inviting.
```

### ✅ AFTER (New Ultra-Realistic Prompt)

```
### PROMPT START ###

## 1. Core Concept
- **Style**: An authentic, high-energy, handheld smartphone selfie video for social media.
- **Action**: Max, a stylish and tech-savvy guy in his mid-20s, is excitedly sharing an amazing shopping hack directly with his followers.

## 2. Visual Style
- **Camera**: Close-up shot, held at arm's length slightly above eye level. The framing is tight on his face. There is a slight, natural handheld shake.
- **Lighting**: Bright, natural light from a window illuminates his face, creating a sparkle in his eyes.
- **Environment**: An authentic, lived-in apartment with a bookshelf and a plant visible in the slightly blurred background.
- **Aesthetic**: Raw, energetic, and genuine. Looks like a real TikTok video, not a polished ad.

## 3. Performance - Visual
- **Eye Contact**: MUST maintain direct, engaging eye contact with the camera lens throughout.
- **Facial Expression**: Start with a wide-eyed, eyebrow-raised look of disbelief. Transition to a huge, genuine smile. When he says "BRUTAL", he should give a quick, confident nod.
- **Body Language**: He leans into the camera when he says "ESCUCHA". He points directly at the viewer when he says "Tienes que probarla". His hands are animated while he talks.
- **Energy Level**: High-energy and infectious enthusiasm from start to finish.

## 4. Performance - Vocal
- **Language & Dialect**: Speak in a natural, colloquial Castilian Spanish (Spain dialect), as if talking to a close friend.
- **Tone & Emotion**: The tone is overwhelmingly EXCITED and AMAZED. His voice should be filled with energy, rising in pitch on the capitalized words.
- **Pacing & Rhythm**: Start fast, then a dramatic PAUSE before the main point. Speed up again, then end with a clear, confident call to action.
- **Vocal Specifics**: Start with an audible, excited "¡Tío!". Emphasize the ALL CAPS words with a vocal PUNCH. Use natural filler words like "o sea" or "pues".

## 5. Script (The Dialogue)
"¡Tío, ESCUCHA! Estaba buscando un portátil nuevo y, o sea, los precios... uff. Pero usé esta app, Max, y en SEGUNDOS me encontró una oferta que era, de verdad, ¡BRUTAL! Tienes que probarla. ¡Descárgala YA, el link está en mi bio!"

## Why The New Prompt Works

| Feature | Old Prompt Issue | New Prompt Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Specificity** | Vague terms like "enthusiastic". | Ultra-specific directions like "wide-eyed, eyebrow-raised look of disbelief". |
| **Tone** | Corporate brand guide language. | Authentic UGC language ("selfie", "handheld", "friend-to-friend"). |
| **Vocal Delivery** | "Says convincingly". | Detailed instructions on tone, pacing, emphasis, and colloquialisms. |
| **Body Language** | "Pointing and smiling". | A choreographed sequence of gestures and movements. |
| **Script** | Formal ad copy. | Natural, colloquial dialogue with filler words and emphasis markers. |
| **Conciseness** | 400+ words of confusing text. | ~200 words of clear, actionable direction. |

By providing this level of detail, you are no longer asking the AI to *interpret* your brand values; you are **directing its performance**. This is the fundamental shift required to achieve the ultra-realistic, exciting results you're looking for. Train Antigravity on this structure, and you will see a dramatic improvement in the quality of your generated videos.
